# pyramid-restful-framework
A RESTful API framework for Pyramid heavily influenced by [django-rest-framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework).

The goal of this project is to provide DRFâ€™s view patterns on a lighter weight web framework that grants you more fine 
grained and explicit control over database queries and object serialization/deserialization. This is accomplished using [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as an ORM and [marshmallow](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/) Schemas for object serialization and deserialization.

[Read the docs]( http://pyramid-restful-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn more.
